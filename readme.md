# Make

Make is a toolbox of functions that mostly serve as wrappers for CIRCUIPython
that is used by the University of Nebraska Lincoln's SPARK RSO to aid in
robotics education. The goal of the project is to create a psuedo-programming
language that middle school/upper elementary aged students can use to code
robots and learn simple programming skills. Intended for use with the MakerPi
RP2040.

This documentation contains a simple introduction to topics covered by the
project so that interested students can self-teach use of the library if
needed, and to provide teachers with resources needed to teach themselves.

[Technical Documentation](doc/techdoc/techdoc.pdf) is also available.
