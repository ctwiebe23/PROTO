# | BAPCAT will take a collection of individual python     |
# | files and combine them into one amalgamation of a file |
# | that contains the contents of each of its constituents |
# | in their entirety, with minor editing and reformatting |
# | to ensure the final "library-like archive file" will   |
# | run                                                    |
# |                                                        |
# | using this tool, we can write code as you would        |
# | normally-- one class to a file, with good file         |
# | structure that ensures we aren't trawling through 200  |
# | lines of unrelated code to find what we're interested  |
# | in, while still producing a single, runnable file that |
# | we can install onto a PI easily                        |
# |                                                        |
# | in short, this script cats each file into one mother   |
# | file with all import statements placed at the start of |
# | the final output and preceded by a short preamble      |
