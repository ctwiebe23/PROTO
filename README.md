# Make

Make is a toolbox of functions that mostly serve as wrappers for CIRCUITPython
that is used by the University of Nebraska Lincoln's PROTO RSO to aid in
robotics education. The goal of the project is to create a psuedo-programming
language that middle school/upper elementary aged students can use to code
robots and learn simple programming skills. For now, only intended for use with
the MakerPi RP2040 and in conjunction with PROTO componants.

This documentation contains a simple introduction to topics covered by the
project.

[Technical Documentation](doc/techdoc/techdoc.pdf) is also available.
