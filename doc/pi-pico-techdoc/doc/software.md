# Introduction

PROTO's Embeddedy Library is intended to provide a simple way to program
robots, such that it can be used in an elementary or middle school setting.  It
is based on Micropython rather than embedded C to circumvent the need for a
compiler, and is as decoupled as possible from the hardware to faciliate
modularity.  To this end, a "schemata" system is used to template hardware
components, which can be swapped in and out when configuring the library.

There two primary users of the library:  young students who are getting an
introduction to robotics, and older mentors who are enabling them.  This
document is intended for the second.

# Use

## Programming robots

The general structure of each program will be similar to that of an Arduino
program.
